# Overview

This program takes a URL and attempts to shorten it. It is not the best since I have a long URL for my URL shortener, 
but the principles are the same. In addition to the shortened URL the program generates a QR code of the shortened URL
for even easier sharing. The program then keeps track of how much each link is used. The static webpage and database
are all hosted by Firebase.

I wrote this to practice Javascript. The program uses multiple statments to create variables, run conditionals, and
change what is displayed on the webpage.

I used Visual studio code as my IDE for this project.

I coded in java script and used Firebase and QRcode libraries.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- A download button or copy button for the QR code and shortened URL.
- A shorter URL (Getting a shorter domain and adding backend functions)
- Adding the abbility to login and see your shortened URLs and their usage.
- The ability to have customizable QR codes.
